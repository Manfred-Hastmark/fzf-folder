# fzf-folder
The purpose of this tool is to be able to fuzzy find
for folder names using fuzzy searching from the command line.
Note that this tool is very much a work in progress and that you can most likely
solve this problem with already existing tools. The main point of this project is to
be a playground for testing tools/features related to C++ development.
